    "One of the simplest examples in probability is the coin toss. It is an experiment with only two possible outcomes. Arbritrarily, we say that the outcome 'heads' is a 'success' and 'tails' is a 'failure'. This simple example is powerful, because many, many relevant experiments have only two possible outcomes, such as whether a person has a disease or does not or whether a component of some product is defective or not. Because such examples are common, they are given a name:\n",
