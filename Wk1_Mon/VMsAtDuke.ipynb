    "* The 'machine image' may be exported to other platforms that support VMs (such as Amazon Web Services). From the perspective of a developer, this means that entire 'appliances' or specialized VMs can be exported whole, with all the software and virtual devices necessary to perform a particular task. From the perspective of a user, this means that all the tools necessary to complete a task may be easily accessed without having to install special packages and such (because this is done upfront by the developer). The VM for this course will be made available as an Amazon Web Services image and as an image that can be run by other VM clients."
